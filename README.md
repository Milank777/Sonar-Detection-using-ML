# Sonar-Detection-using-ML
This project focuses on classifying sonar signals as either Mine or Rock using machine learning models. The dataset contains sonar returns bounced off different surfaces, and the task is to distinguish between natural and man-made objects.  
It demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
- Name: Sonar Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- Samples: 208  
- Features: 60 numerical attributes representing energy levels in different frequency bands  
- Target Classes:  
  - **R** → Rock  
  - **M** → Mine  

# Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **~85–90%** (depending on the ML model and parameter tuning)  
- Models tested: **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest**  
- Visualizations included: **Confusion Matrix, Accuracy/Loss curves**  

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  

# Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning models** for better accuracy  
- Perform **Hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV  
- Deploy the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI** for real-time predictions
